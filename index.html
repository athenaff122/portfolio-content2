			<h2>Welcome to my homepage!</h2>
			<h3>With the background in both business and technology.</h3>
			<p>Hi, I am Athena, a first year student in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, foucusing in Data science. My undergraduate major is economy and business. After graduation, I joined Ernst & Young as an consultant. During that period, I passed all ACCA exams and also become a CFA Level II candidate. </p>
			<p>“Business is the engine, technology is the power”, precisely encapsulates my views on the intersection of business and technology. Instead of being a specialist in either fields, I’d like to be the bridge to interact with both the business users and the data technologies. I look forward to enriching my technical grasp of information systems, database management, and programming through UMSI’s rigorous curriculum. I am excited to participate in Heinz’s experiential learning opportunities, which advocates real-world problem solving. </p>
			<p>I hope to run my business aiming to accelerate automation in business world with peers who share the same ideas like me. I wish to help clients from different industries revolutionize their business model, improve their productivity, and identify new business opportunities. By combining business acumen and technological prowess, I have no doubt that I will be able to realize my ambitious career goals. </p>
			<h3>A Travel Enthusiast</h3>
			<p>I love travelling so much that I even want to a tour guide when I was a child. I have been travelling to Europe, Africa, Morocco, Newzeland, Australia, Korea, Japan.
				Please enjoy my photos during the trip and hope one day I could make big money and travel all day!!</p>
